        <p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
        <h5>Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information</h5>
        <p>In the event that we sell your Personal Information, you have the right to submit a request to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information. You may change your decision at any time and permit us to sell your Personal Information.</p>
        <p>If you do not want us to sell your Personal Information to third parties, please click here or submit your request to our email address: <a href="mailto:info@themarkets.com">info@themarkets.com</a> or to our physical address in the “How to Contact Us” section below (please refer to the ‘<em>Exercising Your Rights’</em> section below).</p>

        <p>The request must:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.</li>
        <li>Describe your request with sufficient details to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
        <li>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.&nbsp; We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</li>

        <h5>Response Timing and Format</h5>
        <p>Our goal is to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing within the first 45 days' period. We will deliver our written response, by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the request. If reasonably possible, we will provide your Personal Information in a format that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information without hindrance.</p>
        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
        <p>In case of rejection, the response we provide will explain the reasons for which we cannot comply with your request.</p>
        <p>Please note that these CCPA rights are not absolute and requests are subject to any applicable legal requirements, including legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
